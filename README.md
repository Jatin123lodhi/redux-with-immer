# redux-with-immer


## Overview
This project focuses on demonstrating the integration of Immer with Redux to streamline state management and improve the development experience. It also showcases the use of Redux Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous operations within Redux, enhancing the versatility of state management in complex applications.

## Setup

- clone the project

- run `npm i`

- start the json server  =>  `json-server --watch db.json`

- run  `node index.js`

- for typescript compilation =>  `tsc -w`

## Concepts Learned
- **Store**: Understanding the role of the Redux store in managing the application state.
- **Reducer**: Creating reducers to handle actions and update the state based on those actions.
- **Action Creators and Action Types**: Defining action creators and action types for effective organization and handling of actions.
- **Dispatched Actions**: Utilizing the dispatch function to send actions to the store and trigger state updates.
- **Redux-Thunk Middleware**: Implementing the Redux-Thunk middleware to handle asynchronous operations within Redux.
- **Combine Reducers**: Combining multiple reducers (e.g., accountReducer, bonusReducer) to manage different parts of the application state.
- **Immer Library**: Utilizing the Immer library to simplify state mutation in reducers while preserving immutability.
